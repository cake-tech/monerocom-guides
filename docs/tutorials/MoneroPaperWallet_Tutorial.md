# How to Create a Monero Paper Wallet: Step-by-Step Guide

Creating a Monero paper wallet is a great way to store your cryptocurrency offline for extra security. In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to create a paper wallet.

## Step 1: Acquire Monero

Before creating a Monero paper wallet, you will need to acquire some Monero. There are multiple ways to do this:

-   Mine it
-   Exchange services or goods for it
-   Convert other cryptocurrencies and fiat money to XMR using an exchange

If you choose to use an exchange, make sure to visit one that supports Monero. Some exchanges are centralized and require personal information before starting the trade, while others are decentralized and don't require identification but have less volume and can be harder to use. You can also meet with someone to perform a trade without third parties involved.

## Step 2: Download and Create a Paper Wallet

To create a Monero paper wallet, follow these steps:

1.  Download the paper wallet generator from [moneroaddress.org](https://moneroaddress.org/) and copy it to a USB stick.
2.  Unzip and open the paper wallet generator (`monero-wallet-generator.html`) in a web browser on an air-gapped computer.
3.  Your paper wallet will have four important items:
    -   Monero Public Address: Used to receive funds to the wallet.
    -   Monero Mnemonic Seed: A method of storing the entire wallet that is easily recognizable to humans.
    -   Monero Spend Key: Used to send funds from the wallet.
    -   Monero View Key: Used to view transactions entering the wallet.
4.  Print the wallet on paper, save it as a PDF or text on a USB stick, burn it to CD/DVD, or choose another secure storage method. Ensure that you have two or three copies stored in different locations. If storing digitally, encrypt everything with a strong password. If storing on paper, do not show the wallet to anyone else who can memorize your 25-word key or take a picture of the wallet without your permission.
5.  Whichever method you choose, make sure there is no copy of the Monero wallet left on the device you used. You may need to securely delete the Monero wallet if you saved it to a disk or make sure your printer does not save a copy in memory.

## Step 3: Send Your Monero to the Paper Wallet

Once you've created your Monero paper wallet, you will need to send your Monero to the wallet address you noted earlier. Make sure the address is correct, even if you copy-pasted it. Remember that if you send the coins to the wrong address, there is no way to have them back! The fastest way to get Monero in your Wallet is transferring from another wallet such as [https://monero.com/](https://monero.com/)

## Step 4: Verify Funds

Since the Monero blockchain is private and untraceable, you won't be able to look up your Monero Public Address and confirm that the funds have arrived like you might with Bitcoin. To securely verify that the funds have arrived in your wallet, you will need to set up a view-only wallet. This is where the view-key comes in. 

That's it! You've successfully created a Monero paper wallet.
